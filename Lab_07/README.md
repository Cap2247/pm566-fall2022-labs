These collections have been ongoing since 2015 and have continued when possible, even throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The consortium has optimized their workflow for the collection, isolation, and sequencing of DNA and RNA collected from these various sites and processing them for metagenomics analysis, including the identification of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Here, the Consortium describes its foundations, and its ongoing work to expand on this network and to focus its scope on the mapping, annotation, and prediction of emerging pathogens, mapping microbial evolution and antibiotic resistance, and the discovery of novel organisms and biosynthetic gene clusters. © 2022 The Authors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 36284135 | SUMMIT: An integrative approach for better transcriptomic data imputation improves causal gene identification.                                              | Genes with moderate to low expression heritability may explain a large proportion of complex trait etiology, but such genes cannot be sufficiently captured in conventional transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs), partly due to the relatively small available reference datasets for developing expression genetic prediction models to capture the moderate to low genetically regulated components of gene expression. Here, we introduce a method, the Summary-level Unified Method for Modeling Integrated Transcriptome (SUMMIT), to improve the expression prediction model accuracy and the power of TWAS by using a large expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) summary-level dataset. We apply SUMMIT to the eQTL summary-level data provided by the eQTLGen consortium. Through simulation studies and analyses of genome-wide association study summary statistics for 24 complex traits, we show that SUMMIT improves the accuracy of expression prediction in blood, successfully builds expression prediction models for genes with low expression heritability, and achieves higher statistical power than several benchmark methods. Finally, we conduct a case study of COVID-19 severity with SUMMIT and identify 11 likely causal genes associated with COVID-19 severity. © 2022.

| 36279491 | Pregnant Through the COVID-19 Chaos: Insights on How Women Use Information in the Perinatal Period During a Pandemic.                                       | <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE/AIMS" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To gain insights in how women use technology to address health information needs during the prenatal and postpartum time frame. An exploratory qualitative study recruited pregnant and recent postpartum women to share their perspectives on information they needed and how they obtained it. Women who were pregnant or \<90 days postpartum (n = 26) were recruited via social media and invited to share their experiences. Design thinking methodology was used to develop questions to understand information needs in the perinatal period as well as in context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Verbatim transcripts were coded by the research team according to Braun and Clarke’s reflexive thematic analysis. Five themes explain the experience of seeking information to support the perinatal period. Women explained the need for the following: (1) information and relationships are inseparable, (2) current practices leave needs unmet, (3) the pandemic exposes vulnerability in prenatal care, (4) left to figure it out alone, and (5) bridging the gap through technology. Aggregated findings suggest how usual care can be modified to improve support for women through personalized care, improved information support, and use of technology. The study findings inform innovative strategies using current technologies to improve health promotion in a dynamic health environment.

| 36265162 | Substance Use From Social Distancing and Isolation By US Nativity During the Time of Covid-19: Cross-Sectional Study.                                       | The Covid-19 pandemic had many unprecedented secondary outcomes resulting in various mental health issues leading to substance use coping behaviors. The extent of substance use changes in a US sample by nativity have not been previously described. Our aim was to design an online survey to assess the social distancing and isolation issues exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic to describe substance use as coping behaviors by comparing substance use changes prior to and during the pandemic. A comprehensive 116-item survey to understand the impact of Covid-19 and social distancing on physical and psychosocial mental health and chronic diseases was designed. Approximately 10,000 online surveys were distributed by Qualtrics LLC between 13 May 2021 and 09 January 2022 across the US (i.e., continental US, Hawaii, Alaska, and territories) to adults 18 and older. We oversampled low income and rural adults among non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic/Latino adults, and foreign-born participants. Of the 5,938 surveys returned, 5,413 surveys were used after Qualtrics proprietary expert review fraud detection, and detailed assessments of completion rate and timing to complete the survey. Participant demographics, substance use coping behaviors, and substance use prior to and during the pandemic are described by the overall US resident sample, followed by US born and foreign-born self-report. Substance use included tobacco use, e-cigarettes/vaping, alcohol use, marijuana use, and other illicit substance use. Marginal homogeneity based on Stuart-Maxwell test was used to assess changes in self-reported substance use prior to and during the pandemic. The sample was mostly White (2182/5413, 40.3%), women (3369/5406, 62.3%) that identified as straight/heterosexual (4805/5406, 89.3%), reported making ≥\$75,000 (1405/5355, 26.2%) and had vocational/technical training (1746/5404, 32.3%). Significant changes were found in alcohol use self-reports the overall sample. Significant changes were also observed among US born and foreign-born samples. Similarities were observed between US born and foreign-born participants on increased alcohol use from: (1) no alcohol use prior to the pandemic to using alcohol once to several times a month; and (2) once to several times per week to everyday to several times per day. While significant changes were observed from no prior alcohol use to some level of increased use, the inverse was observed as well and more pronounced among foreign-born participants. That is, there was a 5.1% overall change in some level of alcohol use prior to the pandemic to no alcohol use during the pandemic among foreign born, compared to the 4.3% change among US born. To better prepare for the inadvertent effects of public health policies meant to protect individuals, we must understand the mental health burdens that can precipitate into substance use coping mechanisms that not only have a deleterious effect on physical and mental health but exacerbate morbidity and mortality to disease like Covid-19. <AbstractText Label="CLINICALTRIAL" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND"/> |
| 36247032 | COVID-19 Restriction Movement Control Order (MCO) Impacted Emissions of Peninsular Malaysia Using Sentinel-2a and Sentinel-5p Satellite.                    | The unprecedented outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted the whole world in every aspect including health, social life, economic activity, education, and the environment. The pandemic has led to an improvement in air quality all around the world, including in Malaysia. Lockdowns have resulted in industry shutting down and road travel decreasing which can reduce the emission of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) and air pollution. This research assesses the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on emissions using the Air Pollution Index (API), aerosols, and GHG which is Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in Malaysia. The data used is from Sentinel-5p and Sentinel-2A which monitor the air quality based on Ozone (O3) and NO2 concentration. Using an interpolated API Index Map comparing 2019, before the implementation of a Movement Control Order (MCO), and 2020, after the MCO period we examine the impact on pollution during and after the COVID-19 lockdown. Data used Sentinel-5p, Sentinel-2A, and Air Pollution Index of Malaysia (APIMS) to monitor the air quality that contains NO2 concentration. The result has shown the recovery in air quality during the MCO implementation which indirectly shows anthropogenic activities towards the environmental condition. The study will help to enhance and support the policy and scope for air pollution management strategies as well as raise public awareness of the main causes that contribute to air pollution. © King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022, Springer Nature or its licensor holds exclusive rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other rightsholder(s); author self-archiving of the accepted manuscript version of this article is solely governed by the terms of such publishing agreement and applicable law.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 36227851 | Forgone Health Care for Non-COVID-19-Related Needs Among Medicare Beneficiaries During the COVID-19 Pandemic, Summer 2020-Winter 2021.                      | Forgone health care, defined as not using health care despite perceiving a need for it, is associated with poor health outcomes, especially among people with chronic conditions. The objective of our study was to examine how the pandemic affected forgone health care during 3 stages of the pandemic. We used the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Rapid Response Questionnaire administered in summer 2020, fall 2020, and winter 2021 to examine sociodemographic characteristics, chronic diseases, COVID-19 vaccination status, and telehealth availability in relation to beneficiary reports of forgone health care. Of the 3 periods studied, the overall rate of forgone health care was highest in summer 2020 (20.8%), followed by fall 2020 (7.8%) and winter 2021 (6.5%). COVID-19 vaccination status, age, sex, race and ethnicity, US region, availability of primary care telehealth appointments, and chronic conditions (heart disease, arthritis, depression, osteoporosis or a broken hip, and diabetes or high blood glucose) were significantly related to forgone care. High rates of forgone care among Medicare participants varied over time and were significantly related to beneficiary characteristics. Our findings highlight the need for health care reform and changes in policy to address the issue of access to care for people with chronic conditions during a pandemic or other public health emergency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 36217024 | Dynamic SARS-CoV-2 emergence algorithm for rationally-designed logical next-generation vaccines.                                                            | SARS-CoV-2 worldwide spread and evolution has resulted in variants containing mutations resulting in immune evasive epitopes that decrease vaccine efficacy. We acquired SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical samples and compared the worldwide emerged spike mutations from Variants of Concern/Interest, and developed an algorithm for monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. The algorithm partitions logarithmic-transformed prevalence data monthly and Pearson’s correlation determines exponential emergence of amino acid substitutions (AAS) and lineages. The SARS-CoV-2 genome evaluation indicated 49 mutations, with 44 resulting in AAS. Nine of the ten most worldwide prevalent (\>70%) spike protein changes have Pearson’s coefficient r \> 0.9. The tenth, D614G, has a prevalence \>99% and r-value of 0.67. The resulting algorithm is based on the patterns these ten substitutions elucidated. The strong positive correlation of the emerged spike protein changes and algorithmic predictive value can be harnessed in designing vaccines with relevant immunogenic epitopes. Monitoring, next-generation vaccine design, and mAb clinical efficacy must keep up with SARS-CoV-2 evolution, as the virus is predicted to remain endemic. © 2022.
